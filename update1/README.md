# Update1: 2020.04.03 - Yale SARS-CoV-2 Genome Surveillance Initiative
This github repository shows preliminary results related to 18 SARS-CoV-2 genomes (from CT[17] and NY[1]) from clinical samples collected between March 13-25, 2020 and sequenced by [Joseph Fauver](https://twitter.com/JosephFauver) and [Tara Alpert](https://twitter.com/tdalpert), using a MinION platform.

## Data

The directories `consensus_genomes` and `metadata` in the [main directory](https://github.com/grubaughlab/CT-SARS-CoV-2) contain all of our current SARS-COV-2 genomes and data.

## Interpretation

*WARNING: These results should be considered as preliminary data*

We added our 27 SARS-COV-2 genomes to 321 available from around the world to understand the timing and origins of the COVID-19 outbreak in Connecticut.

By focusing on just our genomes (CT = light blue; NY = blue-green), we can see that the COVID-19 outbreak in Connecticut was sparked by multiple introductions.

10 of our 27 genomes cluster with those from elsewhere in the United States, primarily with those from Washington state (red). This demonstrates that [coast-to-coast SARS-CoV-2 transmission](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.25.20043828v1) has already occurred in the United States.

7 of our genomes cluster with those sequenced from New York (red) and Europe (faded), indicating that the nearby explosive outbreak in New York is starting to spill over into Connecticut. We did not see this connection with our first 9 genomes, and it is something to watch closely

4 of our genomes cluster together in what may have been an introduction from Europe in early March followed by sustained  local or regional transmission.

The remaining genomes suggest multiple, separate introductions of viruses from European countries such as Belgium and the United Kingdom.
