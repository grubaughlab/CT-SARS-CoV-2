# Update 2: 2020.04.07 - Yale SARS-CoV-2 Genome Surveillance Initiative
This github repository shows preliminary results related to 13 new SARS-CoV-2 genomes (from CT[10] and NY[3]) from clinical samples collected between March 18-19, 2020 and sequenced by Joseph Fauver and Tara Alpert, using a MinION platform.

## Data
The directories `consensus_genomes` and `metadata` in the main page in this repository contain all of our current SARS-COV-2 genomes and metadata.

## Interpretation

*WARNING: These results should be considered as preliminary data*

## Nextstrain
We added the new 13 SARS-COV-2 genomes with other 27 genomes we presented in the previous update, and collected other XXX genomes available on GISAID, from around the world, to uncover recent patterns of viral spread within and from Northeastern USA in the past weeks.
