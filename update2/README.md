# Update 2: 2020.04.07 - Yale SARS-CoV-2 Genome Surveillance Initiative
This github repository shows preliminary results related to 13 new SARS-CoV-2 genomes (from CT[10] and NY[3]) from clinical samples collected between March 18-19, 2020 and sequenced by Joseph Fauver and Tara Alpert, using a MinION platform.

## Data
The directories `consensus_genomes` and `metadata` in the main page in this repository contain all of our current SARS-COV-2 genomes and metadata.

## Interpretation

*WARNING: These results should be considered as preliminary data*

## Nextstrain
We added the new 13 SARS-COV-2 genomes with other 27 genomes we presented in the previous update, and collected other XXX genomes available on GISAID, from around the world, to uncover recent patterns of viral spread within and from Northeastern USA in the past weeks.

A total of nine of the newly sequenced genomes in this update are found within a growing cluster of viruses sampled in NY and CT between March 12th and 25th, 2020. They add extra evidence for sustained local or regional transmission of the virus causing COVID-19 within and between both states.

One of the newly sequenced genomes (Yale-020) is member of a lineage of viruses that seems to be circulating locally in Connecticut over the past weeks. These genomes were collected from residents of the New Haven County and surrounding areas. The data for the specific lineage is still limited, and as we sequence more genomes, we may be able to estimate the extent of the viral spread from this region in CT.

In other branch of the tree one can find four genomes sequenced by the Yale initiative, one of them sequenced in the last week as part of this report. These genomes are group within a cluster of viruses with most likely origin in Western Europe, representing at least one introduction of this lineage in the United States at some point in February.

Finally, one of the genomes (Yale-012) groups together with other 12 genomes sequenced by our team, which were found to member of a cluster most likely introduced from Washington state (see Update 1). These CT samples were collected from residents of many distinct locations in CT, such as the sourthern CT towns/city of New Haven, West Haven, Greenwich, Woodbridge, and Stratford, as well as Bethlehem, Litchfield, and Berlin, in the northern part.

Altogether, the patterns we observe with the genomic data gathered so far highlights that the virus causing COVID-19 is widely spread in Connecticut. Staying home, specially the elderly and people with underlying health conditions, is advisable to avoid exposure to the virus SARS-CoV-2.
