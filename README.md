# Yale SARS-CoV-2 Genome Surveillance Initiative
In collaboration with the Yale School of Public Health, Yale School of Medicine, Yale New Haven Health, Yale University Environmental Engineering, and the CT Department of Public Health, we are using genomic epidemiology to uncover hidden patterns of the COVID-19 outbreak in Connecticut, the Northeast, and across the United States. This repository contains all of our data, results, and code.

*WARNING: These results should be considered as preliminary data*

### Sequence data

The directory `consensus-genomes` contains the consensus SARS-CoV-2 genomes that we sequenced on the MinION from Connecticut and New York from clinical and environmental samples.

The directory 'metadata' contains all of the associated information for each sequence.

### Nextstrain

The directory `auspice` contains the json that was produced using augor from the nextstrain pipeline. These results can be visualized using auspice, accessing the link below:

## Update1: 2020.04.03 

The directory `update1` contains the data, interpretation, and visualization of 18 of our new SARS-CoV-2 genomes (out of 27 total).

## Paper1: Coast-to-coast spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States revealed by genomic epidemiology

The directory `paper1` contains the data, results, and code for our recent manuscript submitted to *medRxiv*. The paper can be accessed using the following link:
